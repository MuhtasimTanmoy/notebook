# Design Pattern - Elements of reusable object oriented Software

Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing reusable object-oriented software is even harder.

- The design patterns in this book are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.

- Class patterns deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses. These relationships are established through inheritance, so they are static, fixed at compile-time.

- Object patterns deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic.
    - Creational class patterns defer some part of object creation to subclasses, while Creational object patterns defer it to another object. 
    - The Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose classes, while the Structural object patterns describe ways to assemble objects. 
    - The Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to describe algorithms and flow of control, whereas the Behavioral object patterns describe how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can carry out alone.

- Composite is often used with Iterator or Visitor. Some patterns are alternatives: Prototype is often an alternative to Abstract Factory. Some patterns result in similar designs even though the patterns have different intents. For example, the structure diagrams of Composite and Decorator are similar.
