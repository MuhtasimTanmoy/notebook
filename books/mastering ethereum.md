# Masrtering Ethereum

Account

- An object containing an address, balance, nonce, and optional storage and code.
An account can be a contract account or an externally owned account (EOA).

Block

- A collection of required information (a block header) about the comprised trans‐
actions, and a set of other block headers known as ommers. Blocks are added to
the Ethereum network by miners.

Blockchain

- In Ethereum, a sequence of blocks validated by the proof-of-work system, each
linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block. This varies from the
Bitcoin protocol in that it does not have a block size limit; it instead uses varying gas limits.

- Bytecode

An abstract instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software inter‐
preter or a virtual machine. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecode is
expressed in numeric format.

- HD wallet seed

A value used to generate the master private key and master chain code for an HD
wallet. The wallet seed can be represented by mnemonic words, making it easier
for humans to copy, back up, and restore private keys.

Ethereum is a deterministic but practically
unbounded state machine, consisting of a globally accessible singleton state and a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.

Ethereum is an open source, globally decentral‐
ized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts. It uses a
blockchain to synchronize and store the system’s state changes, along with a crypto‐
currency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs.

- A peer-to-peer network connecting participants
- A Byzantine fault–tolerant consensus algorithm for synchronization of state updates (a proof-of-work blockchain)
- The use of cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures and hashes, and a digital currency (ether)
