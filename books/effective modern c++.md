# Effective Modern C++

- Auto declarations, range-based for loops, lambda expressions, and rvalue references change the face of C++, to say nothing of the new concurrency features. And then there are the idiomatic changes. 
- 0 and typedefs are out, nullptr and alias declarations are in. 
- Enums should now be scoped. 
- Smart pointers are now preferable to built-in ones. - Moving objects is normally better than copying them.
