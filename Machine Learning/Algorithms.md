- Variance
    - How spread out the data is
- Co- variance 

- Reinforcement Learning
- SVM
    - Support Vector Machine
- Maximal margin classifier


The inability for machine learning algorithm to capture true relationship is called bias.
- Very sensitive to training data then low bias, high variance
- Less sensitive to training data means high bias, low variance


- Make new dimension to get SVM to classify
- Regularization
- Bagging Boosting 
    - Finding that sweet spot
