- One node needs
    - Database
        - Block storage
    - `P2P` Network
        - JsonRPC
            - Submit transaction
            - Get data about events that happen onchain
            - Read some of the storage onchain
        - libp2p
            - one node in the network connect with another
    - Block Authoring
    - Fork Choice Rules
    - Transaction Handling
        - Tx Pool
    - State Transition Function ( Runtime )
        - Compiled down to `wasm`
        - Runs on all platforms
        - Store `wasm` on chain which allows `forkless runtime update`
        - Upgrade blockchain without hard fork, putting runtime logix there
        - Sudo pallet for testing
    - Concensus
        - Authoring
            - PoW
            - Aura
            - Babe
