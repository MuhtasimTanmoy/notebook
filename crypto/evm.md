- [EVM: From Solidity to byte code, memory and storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxL_1AfV7N4)
    - Solidity and viper EVM language which generates `.bin` and `.abi`
    - Transactions are not part of the world state or state tree
        - It will be part of the information that gets linked to the block header which is a summary of all transactions
    - Contract is the transaction with no address, and only data
    - Full-flow walkthrough

    - Bytecode
        - Loader code
            - Execute once to store runtime code
        - Runtime code
            - Can map bytecode to EVM assembly
            - Reconstruct the control flow graph
            - Runtime code entry point is the dispatcher function
                - Switch to the first four bytes of the transaction payload
                - Execute associated code with the given function signature

    - Why?
        - Transaction fees
        - Block confirmation times
        - Liquidity Pool
    - CrossChain Protocol Stack
        - Application
            - Built on function
        - Function Call
            - Execution
        - Messaging
            - Verification
    - Ethereum Event
        - Event can be proven to come from certain blockchain 
    - Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLC) 
        - Trustless
        - Decentralized exchange can only trade for assets on same blockchain
        - Atomic Swaps

    - Floodsub -> RandomSub -> GossipSub
    - Eager push
    - Lazy pull 
    - Peer scoring each node
    - Keep connection with the highest score
    - First message flood
    - Then adaptive, flood local mesh, lazy pull others
    - Backoff and prune based on score
