# Remote Attestation

`Remote attestation` is a method by which a host (client) authenticates itâ€™s hardware and software
configuration to a remote host (server). The goal of remote attestation is to enable a remote
system (challenger) to determine the level of trust in the integrity of platform of another system
(attestator).
