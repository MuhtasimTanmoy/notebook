# Memory Profiler

- [Measuring memory usage in Rust](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/12/04/measuring-memory-usage-in-rust.html)
    - The application does too many short-lived allocations (instead of re-using the buffers) the `instrumenting the calls to allocation and deallocation approach`.If in a steady state, the application uses too much memory, the `heap parsing` would work better for pointing out which data structures need most attention.

- [How to write heap memory profiler?](https://youtu.be/YB0QoWI-g8E)
- Goals
    - Cope with thousands or even millions of trace events per second
    - Ideally zero overhead when not used
    - Support for runtime attaching or similar

- Good to
    - Prefer to use existing tracing frameworks
    - perf with sdt / uprobe
    - LLVM - Xray

- Steps
    - Inject custom code into application
    - Intercept call to heap allcoation, deallocation function
    - Backtrace deallocation and allcoation 
    - Tracing, profiling should be fast, Post process should be delayed.

- Target `functions`

```c++

// libc functions
malloc, free
realtoc, calloc
posix_memalign, aligned_alloc, vat loc

// libc++ functions
operator new, operator new[]]
operator delete, operator delete[]
Each with a couple of overloads, e.g. std: :atign_val_t

```

- Approach
    - Use the dynamic linker to inject custom library code.
    - `LD_PRELAOD=$(readlink -f path/to/lib.so) app`
    - `c++` does not define how linker works, it works on linux level.
    - Basically replacing library `malloc` call.

- Good to know before understanding the code below    
    - Learn about [`extern`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10422034/when-to-use-extern-in-c)
        - Declare anywhere, use that declared part.
    - Learn about [`dlsym`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/dlsym.html#:~:text=DESCRIPTION,name%20as%20a%20character%20string.)
    - [Static cast vs reinterpret_cast](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/573294/when-to-use-reinterpret-cast)
    - `reinterpret_cast` is dangerous
        - `class object -> func(param one)` gets converted to `class::func(*this, param)`.
    - `reinterpret_cast` can perform dangerous conversions because it can typecast any pointer to any other pointer.
    - reinterpret_cast is used when you want to work with bits.
    - The result of a reinterpret_cast cannot safely be used for anything other than being cast back to its original type.
    - If we use this type of cast then it becomes `non-portable` product.

```c++
#include <dlfcn.h> // dlsym
extern "C" {
        void* malloc(sizt_t size) {

            static void* original_malloc(RTLD_NEXT ,"malloc") ;

            assert(original_malloc);

            auto *original_malloc_fn = reinterpret_cast<decltype(&::malloc)> (original_malloc);

            void â€¢ret = original_malloc_fn(size);

            fprtntf(stderr, "mattoc intercepted: gozu oop\n",
            size, ret);
            return ret;
        }
}
```


# Type cast
- Static cast

```c++

// Used to explicitly find out if casted
a = f;
a = static_cast<int>(f);

// Conversion construtor
// Conversion operator
class Int {
int x;
public:
    Int(int x=0) {
        cout << "conversion constructor" << endl;
    }
    operator string ( ) {
        cout << "conversion operator" << endl;
        return to_string(x);
    }
}

int main() {
    Int obj(3);

    // Compile time casting 
    string str = obj;
    obj = 20;
}


// Prevents chat to int type cast at compile time
// In every case provides better security than c style (void *) cast

// For compatible type conversion, such as float to int.
// For conversion operator and conversion constructors.
// To avoid unrelated pointer conversion.
// Avoids derived to private base pointer conversion.
// Use for all up-cast but never use for confused down-cast because there are no runtime checks performed
// Intensions are more clear in C++ style cast (express your intent better and make code review easier)
// Finding is easy.
//  Error found at compile-time.
```

- Const cast 
    - To remove const

 - Dynamic Cast
    - In order to use it, must have `virtual function` in base class.
    - Work only on polymorphic base class (at least one virtual function in base class) because it uses this information to decide about wrong down-cast.
    - It is used for up-cast (D to B) and down-cast (B to D), but it is mainly used for correct downcast.
    - Using this cast has run time overhead, because it checks object types at run time using RTTI (Run Time Type Information).
    - If we are sure that we will never cast to wrong object then we should always avoid this cast and use static_cast.
