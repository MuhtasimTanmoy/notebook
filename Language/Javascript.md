# JavaScript

JavaScript can be divided into three cores (pillars):

Types:
- Primitive Types
- Abstract Operations
- Coercion
- Equality
- TypeScript, Flow, etc.

Scope:
- Nested Scope
- Hoisting
- Closure
- Modules

Objects (Oriented):
- this
- class{}
- Prototypes
- OO vs. OLOO

- Coercion
    - Converting a value from one type to another is often called “type casting”, when done explicitly, and “coercion” when done implicitly (forced by the rules of how a value is used).

- double equals (==) will perform a type conversion when comparing two things, and will handle NaN, -0, and +0 specially to conform to IEEE 754 (so NaN != NaN, and -0 == +0);

- triple equals (===) will do the same comparison as double equals (including the special handling for NaN, -0, and +0) but without type conversion; if the types differ, false is returned.
