- Memory barriers
    - Can be used to prevent compilers to reorder operations, instructions for instructionn level parallelism

- [spinlock](https://github.com/CoffeeBeforeArch/spinlocks)
    - Other locks waiting to get to sleep
    - Spin lock polls in loop for atomic bool to be available
    - Naive approach very high l1-dcache-load-misses
        - Four main categories of cache misses
            - Compulsory misses
            - Capacity misses
            - Conflict misses
            - Coherence misses
