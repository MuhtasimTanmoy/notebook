- Interface
    - Method signature
    - Property declaration
- Trait
    - Method bodies
    - Property declaration
    - A trait also has the actual method bodies. In other words, a trait adds code to an interface. Used by protocol extension.
- Mixin
    - Method bodies
    - Stored properties
    - A mixin is like a trait but it also has state. Not avaialable in protocol.
    - Property declaration to a protocol, but then every class or struct that conforms to this protocol still needs to provide its own storage for those properties.
