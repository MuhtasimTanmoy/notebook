- Static Linking
    - File Size Increase
    - No update as lib source code gets embedded

- Dynamic Linking
    - File Size Small
    - Update as only address goes into binary

- macOS
    - static: `.a`
    - dynamic: `.dylib`

- Linux
    - static: `.so`
    - dynamic: `.dylib`

- Windows
    - static: `.lib`
    - dynamic: `.dll`
