# Starting and Stopping Nginx

```
nginx # start
nginx -s stop
nginx -s reload
```


A light weight reverse proxy.

Suppose you have a server and you are running two web apps on it. One on port 8000 and one on 8001. Now suppose we have a domain name "example.com". We want "abc.example.com" to get routed to port 8000 of the machine and "xyz.example.com" to get routed to 8001 port of the machine.

For that, we create 1 file for each web app we want to configure at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`. The file names could be anything. Let's just name them same as the sub-domain they represent.

I mostly code in nodejs. So I usually have web app running on localhost. So the configuration looks like this:

```
server {
    listen 80; listen [::]:80;
    server_name abc.example.com;  # <-- change this

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; # <-- And this
    }
}
```



# How to add a site

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
touch site.conf
vim site.conf

# Paste the following inside site.conf
server {
    listen 80; listen [::]:80;
    server_name a.domain.com;  # <-- change this

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

# Adding SSL

Adding ssl protection is very easy now. We just need to install certbot and use it.

```
# First install certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx

# Next run it
sudo certbot --nginx

certbot will handle the rest.

# Renew Certificate
sudo apt upgrade certbot
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
sudo certbot renew

# Check expiration dates
certbot certificates
```

# How to enforce https?

```
if ($scheme != "https") {
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
} # managed by Certbot
```

# Mixed content error

We once got mixed content error after upgrading to ssl. In order to fix the issue, we simply had to add some headers to location block.

```
location / {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
  proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
}
```
