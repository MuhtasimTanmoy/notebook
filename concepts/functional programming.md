# Functional programming

- Object-oriented programming gives bad habits about functional programming as we have lots of void functions, if a function does not return anything why would we need one?

- Thread-Safe
    - As if executed one after another even executed at the same time
- Reentrant
    - Can be paused anytime by `isr()` and resumed later.
