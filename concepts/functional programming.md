# Functional programming

- Object oriented programming gives bad habit about functional programming as we have lots of void functions, if a function does not return anything why would we need one?

- Thread-Safe
    - As if executed one after another even executed at same time
- Reentrant
    - Can be paused anytime by `isr()` and resumed later.
