# Remote Attestation

- `Remote attestation` is a method by which a host (client) authenticates its hardware and software configuration to a remote host (server). 

- The goal of remote attestation is to enable a remote system `challenger` to determine the level of trust in the integrity of the platform of another system
`attestator`.

- Enclave has sort of the same idea as TPM
    - Intel Trusted Execution Tech
    - AMD PSP
