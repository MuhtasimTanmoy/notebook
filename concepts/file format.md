# File Format

- GIF
    - The only framerates that GIF supports are: 100, 50, 33.33, 25, 20, 16.66, 14.3, 12.5, 11.11, 10, and lower (100/n). There's no way to say you want 60fps. You can say you want some frames played at 100fps, some at 50fps, alternating so that it sort-of averages to about 60fps.
