- The Sia software divides files into 30 segments before uploading, each targeted for distribution to hosts across the world. 
- File segments are created using a technology called Reed-Solomon erasure coding, commonly used in CDs and DVDs. Erasure coding allows Sia to divide files in a redundant manner, where any 10 of 30 segments can fully recover a user's files.
- This means that if 20 out of 30 hosts go offline, a Sia user is still able to download her files.
- Threefish encryption algorithm.
- Merkle construction phase requires heavy preprocessing. Logarithmic of the file size.
