# ZooKeeper

- Zookeeper is a system for distributed cluster management. It is a distributed key-value store. It is highly-optimized for reads but writes are slower. It consists of an odd number of znodes known as an ensemble.

- zookeeper as the backbone for maintaining cluster state and leader election.

- Zookeeper solves these problems using its magical tree structure file system called znodes, somewhat similar to the Unix file system. These znodes are analogous to folders and files in a Unix file system with some additional magical abilities :) Zookeeper provides primitive operations to manipulate these znodes, through which we will solve our distributed system problems.
