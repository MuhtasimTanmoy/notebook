# Accelerated C++

- An expression asks the implementation to compute something. The computation yields a result, and may also have
side effects-that is, it may affect the state of the program or the implementation in ways that are not directly part of
the result. 
- For example, 3+4 is an expression that yields 7 as its result, and has no side effects, and
`std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl` is an expression that, as its side effect, writes Hello, world! on the standard output stream and ends the current line.
